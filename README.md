# Get And Clean Data
Course Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data
The R program,run_analysis.R, reads from multiple files and creates 
one output text file, Project.txt.  The Project.txt file is a summary
of the mean and std measures from the input files by subjects and activities.

The input data files, X_train.txt and X_test.txt, contain measures recorded
of activities for subjects. There were 30 subjects and 5 activities. There are 
multiple observations per subject, and for each subject there are multiple 
observations per activity.

88 Selected measures were averaged by subject and activity and outputted to Project.txt.
During processing of the data the measures (columns) were labelled and the rows were
identified by subject and activity.
